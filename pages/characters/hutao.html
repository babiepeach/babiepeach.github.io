	<h3>MORE INFO:</h3>

	<p>
		Hu Tao is the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, taking over presumably from
		her father, the 76th Director, or from her Grandfather, the 75th Director, who bore her
		the hat she wears today. She is also rather adept in the art of Poetry, and has shared this
		with Xingqiu. The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor can be estimated to being between 2000-5000 years
		old, as it was founded part-way through the Archon War to help rid of a plague bestowed upon
		Liyue by the Yaksha and the bodies it lay in its wake. Her Pyro vision is not often acknowledged
		by Hu Tao, however she appreciates it as a recognition of her strength and resilience.
